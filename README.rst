django-maintenancemode-2
========================

|Build Status|

Current Version: 2.0.0

This project makes it easy to put your Django site into “maintenance
mode”, or more technically, return an HTTP 503 response.

This project differs slightly from other implementations in that the
maintenance mode flag is stored in your database versus settings or an
environment variable. If your site is deployed to multiple servers, the
centralized database-based maintenance flag makes it a snap to bring
them all up or down at once.

Requirements
------------

-  `django <https://www.djangoproject.com/download/>`__
-  `django.contrib.sites <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/sites/>`__

Pre-Requisites
--------------

You must have at least one Site entry in your database **before**
installing django-maintenancemode-2.

Supported Python Versions
-------------------------

-  2.7, 3.x

Supported Django Versions
-------------------------
-  4.x use the latest version
-  2.x >= 3.x, please use version 1.3.1
-  < 2, please use version 1.1.9

Installation
------------

1. ``pip install django-maintenancemode-2``

– or –

1. Download django-maintenancemode-2 from
   `source <https://github.com/alsoicode/django-maintenancemode-2/archive/master.zip>`__
2. \*optional: Enable a virtualenv
3. Run ``python setup.py install`` or add ``maintenancemode`` to your
   PYTHONPATH

Settings and Required Values
----------------------------

-  Ensure the `Sites
   Framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/sites/>`__
   is enabled, and you have at least one entry in the Sites table.
-  Add ``maintenancemode.middleware.MaintenanceModeMiddleware`` to your
   ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``
-  Add ``maintenancemode`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
-  Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the ``maintenancemode``
   tables.
-  Run your project to automatically add the ``maintenancemode``
   database records.
-  Add a 503.html template to the root of your templates directory, or
   optionally add a ``MAINTENANCE_503_TEMPLATE`` path to your 503.html
   file’s location in settings.
-  ``maintenancemode`` will ignore any patterns beginning with the
   default Django Admin url: ``^admin`` so you can turn it off. If you
   use a custom url for admin, you may override the ignored admin
   patterns by adding the ``MAINTENANCE_ADMIN_IGNORED_URLS`` list in
   settings. Example: ``['^my-custom-admin', '^my-other-custom-admin']``
-  You can also block staff users, who by default are ignored by
   maintenance mode, by setting ``MAINTENANCE_BLOCK_STAFF`` to ``True``

Turning Maintenance Mode **On**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To put a site into “Maintenance Mode”, check the “In Maintenance Mode”
checkbox and save in Django Admin under the “Maintenancemode” section.
The next time you visit the public side of the site, it will return a
503 if:

-  You are not logged in as a superuser or staff user
-  You are not viewing a URL in the ignored patterns list
-  Your ``REMOTE_ADDR`` does not appear in the ``INTERNAL_IPS`` setting

Or you can alternatively use the ``setmaintenance`` management command:

    # sets maintenance on for the current settings.SITE_ID
    ./manage.py setmaintenance on

    # sets maintenance on for sites 2 and 3
    ./manage.py setmaintenance on 2 3

which can be useful for ``fabric`` deployment scripts etc.

Turning Maintenance Mode **Off**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log in, un-check the “In Maintenance Mode” checkbox and save.

Or you can alternatively use the ``setmaintenance`` management command:

    # sets maintenance off for the current settings.SITE_ID
    $ ./manage.py setmaintenance off

    # sets maintenance off for sites 2 and 3
    $ ./manage.py setmaintenance off 2 3

Testing and Sample Application
------------------------------

A “testproject” application is included, which also contains unit and
functional tests you can run via ``python manage.py test`` from the
``testproject`` directory.

You will need to run ``manage.py migrate`` to create the test project
database.

There are only two views in the testproject: - / - /ignored-page

To see ``maintenancemode`` in action, log into Django admin, and set the
maintenance mode to true. Log out, then visit the home page, and
instead, you’ll be greeted with the maintenance page.

To have ``maintenancemode`` ignore the “ignored-page” view, simply add
it’s url pattern to the Ignored URLs as:

::

   ^ignored-page/$

Now you should be able to visit the ``ignored-page`` view regardless of
the maintenancemode status. This is useful for contact or help pages you
still want people to be able to access while you’re working on other
parts of the site.

Database migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``./manage.py migrate`` should add the necessary tables.
