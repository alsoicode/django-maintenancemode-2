0.9.1
- - - - -

- Tested django - maintenancemode with django - 1.0 release (following the 1.0.X release branch)
- Bundled buildout.cfg and bootstrap with the source version of the project, allowing repeatable buildout
- The middleware now uses its own default config file, thanks to a patch by semente
- Use INTERNAL_IPS to check for users that need access. user.is_staff will stay in place for backwards incompatibility. Thanks for the idea Joshua Works
- Have setup.py sdist only distribute maintenancemode itself, no longer distribute tests and buildout stuff
- Use README and CHANGES in setup.py's long_description, stolen from Jeroen's djangorecipe :)
- Updated the documentation and now use pypi as the documentation source (link there from google code)
